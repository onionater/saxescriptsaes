If there is a conflict during a merge, 3 files with the same basename are created. The filename of the common base is appended with “.BASE”, the filename of the file containing your changes is appended with “.THIS” and the filename with the changes from the other tree is appended with “.OTHER”. Using a program such as kdiff3, you can now comfortably merge them into one file. In order to commit you have to rename the merged file (“.THIS”) to the original file name. To complete the conflict resolution you must use the resolve command, which will remove the “.OTHER” and “.BASE” files. As long as there exist files with .BASE, .THIS or .OTHER the commit command will report an error.
